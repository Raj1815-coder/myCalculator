This is a simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It includes basic operations and features like exponent handling and a power ON/OFF toggle.

This Calculator project was inspired by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez) Here is the video of his tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5kj-YsmWjM

In addition to this, I added extra features like power On/Off button and exponent calculations on my own.
